This project is part of my coding journey. I have always been a huge fan the brand Lestrange and loved their website. 
I reacreated part of their site using: HTML, CSS & Javascript and made a few changes to the design.

The project uses an API integration with Directus pulling in all of the JSON product data, then displays it as products in the shop. 

This is an ongoing project that I will expand on as I learn more.
