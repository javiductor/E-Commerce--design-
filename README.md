<p>This project is part of my coding journey. I have always been a huge fan the brand Lestrange and loved their website.
I reacreated part of their site using: HTML, CSS & Javascript and made a few changes to the design.</p>

<p>The project uses an API integration with Directus pulling in all of the JSON product data, then displays it as products in the shop.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing project that I will expand on as I learn more.</p>
